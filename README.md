## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 Markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media Queries

### Continued development

I'm going to keep focusing on best practices, Flexbox and media queries, some necessary things I'm not that familiar with yet.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries Reference (MDN Web Docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me to use media queries, making a first and simple try.
